# The Everything Quiz

## User Experience

### User Stories
As a user I want to:

* test my general knowledge with a quiz.
* be able to initiate the start of the quiz.
* be able to understand how to take the quiz.
* be able to select a difficulty before starting the quiz.
* know my current score.
* know how far along the quiz I am.
* know whether my answer is correct or wrong.
* know my final score.
* be able to take the quiz again after completion.

## Site Structure

### Wireframes

I created basic wireframes of how I wanted the layout of the site to look using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

## Design Choices

### Font
* The font used throughout the site is "montserrat" with "sans-serif" as the secondary font.
    * I chose this particular font because I wanted something simple and easy to read.
    * The fact that the user will need to be able to quickly read the questions and the answer options in the quiz means that the font should ideally be well defined and easy to read.
